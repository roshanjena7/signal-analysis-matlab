# Signal Analysis using MATLAB

## 📌 Objective
To analyze an electrical signal in both time domain and frequency domain using MATLAB.

## 🧠 Theory
Time domain analysis shows how a signal varies with time.  
Frequency domain analysis (FFT) shows the frequency components present in the signal.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- MATLAB R2025b

## ⚙ Methodology
1. Generate a sinusoidal signal
2. Plot time-domain waveform
3. Apply Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
4. Plot frequency-domain response

## 📈 Results
- Time domain plot clearly shows sinusoidal behavior
- Frequency domain plot shows dominant frequency at 50 Hz

## 🔍 Conclusion
MATLAB efficiently analyzes electrical signals and helps visualize frequency components, which is essential in signal processing and power systems.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add noise analysis
- Filter design
- Real signal input
